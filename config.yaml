    title: "Anusha Sonte Parameshwar"
    subtitle: Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Anusha Sonte Parameshwar, a passionate Computer Science graduate student pursuing my [**Masters at Illinois Institute of Technology**](https://www.iit.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms). With 3 years of work experience in the software industry, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise to my work. My professional journey started at [**HSBC**](https://www.hsbc.com/), where I spent 2.5 years as a Software Engineer. During this time, I contributed to several complex projects, including a major rewrite of the mainframe-based modules into API-based modules that were delivered with zero defects. After that, I joined [**Salesforce**](https://www.salesforce.com/) as a Development Success Engineer, where I honed my problem-solving skills by resolving development issues for end-users. This role also gave me opportunities to interact with customers and understand their needs and pain points in detail. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books and exploring new technologies.
