### Description
Received recognition for developing an API that transformed the customer whitelisting process. Previously, this task would take 2-3 hours and be prone to errors, but with the new API, it can now be completed in just 6 seconds without any errors. This accomplishment demonstrated a strong ability to problem-solve and improve efficiency, making a notable impact on operational effectiveness.
