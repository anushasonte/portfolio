## Description

- Revised, modularized and updated old code bases i.e., from mainframe based to API based right from  developing API using Mule + Java + Spring boot, accessing data from Oracle DB, Mongo DB using Hibernate to deploying it using Jenkins and performance testing using J-Meter.
- Proactively contributed to the improvement of existing systems, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience by developing an API that automates customer whitelisting. This process which used to take 2-3 hours earlier and was error prone can now be done in less than 6 seconds with no errors.
- Independently led and executed a seamless MD5 to SHA-2 migration process, achieving a 100% successful migration rate for all impacted data.
- Leveraged JPA for efficient object-relational mapping and database access in Java applications.
- Implemented Spring Security for role-based authentication and authorization in Java applications.
- Utilized Checkmarx and SonarQube tools to actively monitor unit testing progress and identify vulnerabilities in code, ensuring robust software quality.
- Configured and used logging framework Log4j to capture and analyze application logs.
- Configured CI/CD pipelines by employing tools such as Jenkins to automate the testing and deployment processes.
