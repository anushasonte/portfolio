## Description
Implemented a comprehensive conversion process that seamlessly migrates from MD5 to SHA-2 hashing algorithms. This transition significantly enhances the resistance against collision attacks and provides a stronger layer of security for critical data. Rigorously tested the implementation to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of the SHA-2 hashing algorithm. Conducted extensive quality assurance measures to identify and address potential vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks.
